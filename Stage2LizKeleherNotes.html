          Now that I know that what displays on a computer is really the bi-product of a computer reading the directions from someone coding in the computer's "language," what I thought was really hard and complex seems less daunting.

          <div class="supporting-info">
            <p>
            It's helpful to realize everything on the web is a box. Now, when I'm thinking about how I'm going to write my code, I can visualize what boxes go where and how to divide things.
            </p>

        <div class="supporting-info">
          <p>
            HTML and CSS work together for structure and style. You can use tags that add <span style="color:orange">specific colors</span>
            <a style="font-size: 130%;">or resize the font.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything on the web page is a box. Your HTML determines the structure of the boxes and you can change the style of the boxes with CSS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="supporting-info">
          <p>
          First, you create a shell of the page you are trying to create by thinking in terms of how many boxes and where they will go. Then, you create reminders for yourself about what you will put in each with "classes" like title, image, etc...

          <p>
            I'm still challenged to visualize where the different elements of CSS come in to work together. I understand they are both needed to create structure and style, but I want to learn more about how they are partners to support one another and how I'll keep the two that way in my mind as I write my code. In codepen I see that each line of HTML has a corresponding line of CSS- is this how I add that in? I put the CSS in the same line?

        <h3>Including your CSS</h3>
        <div class="supporting-info">
        <p>
        In CSS you choose the selector you want to apply the style to.

              <p>
                Best practices from the article say to keep your style seperate from your HTML file. AHA moment! CSS does not need to line up with the right place in your code. You use selectors to tell the computer which parts of your code should be in which styles.
              </p>
              <p>
                You use a tag like this &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css¬ù&gt; to connect your CSS to your HTML

        <p>
          Always think about minimizing the amount of code you have to write. You can do this by organizing it and applying the CSS rules in order to bucket things together. This will also help if you work on it again or if you let other people work with your code.

              Admiral Grace Hopper carried around "nanosticks" that were pieces of wire that represent the length light would travel in a nanosecond. She wrote compilers, which did all the work at once and then ran the program.) My very favorite quote from her interview with David Letterman was when he asked her, <em>"How did you know so much about computers?"</em> and Hopper said, <em>"I didn't. That was the first one!"</em> I really connected with this because I still feel intimidated at times by this subject. Realizing that not long ago this was new to everyone and that programmers are still figuring everything out, helps.

        <h3>Strings</h3>
        <div class="supporting-info">
          <ul>
            <li>Strings are a sequence of characters surrounded by single or double quotes.</li>
            <li>If you want the words to show up, you have to put them in quotes.</li>
            <li>If you use words without them, you must first define them as a variable.</li>
            <li>+ means "concatenate" or put together (not add)</li>
            <li>put spaces inside your quotes to indicate where the space should be</li>
            <li>indexing: use brackets and numbers to choose one thing from the string (positions in strings start with 0) You can also use negative numbers if you don't know where the end is, or it is a long string</li>
            <li>sub-sequencing: choose a rnage of things by using a semicolon [expression: expression] If you want the beginning to the number or the number to the end, leave a space before or after the brackets</li>
            <li>finding strings in strings: .find is a procedure in Python. The output is the position of the first occurence. Capitalization matters. If the string can't be found, the output will be -1. no quotes is a variable you need to define. ‚Äú‚Äù or ‚Äò‚Äô is exactly what you type so, s.find(s) is always 0 and  s.find(‚Äôs‚Äô) depends on if there is an actual letter s in the variable s</li>
            <li>an empty string exists before and between all things in a string. These spaces count as a position.</li>
            <li>Parameter: In "text".find('t') the 't' is the parameter.</li>
            <li>If you count from the beginning of a string, when choosing the end, choose the number after because it is inclusive. Going from the end backward is exclusive, so choose the last position you want.</li>
            <li>Use the shortest possible solution to allow you to apply it to many things</li>
